                            I am
                            passionate about
                            programming and foresee that all people in the world will at least know some technique of
                            computational thinking to help their job.That's why i am here.<span

                        <p class="paragraph">I have four projects needed to finish, each utilizing different
                            programming languages and technologies, including JavaScript, Python, web server
                            programming,
                            backend development, and data engineering. My first project is an implementation of Conway's
                            Game of Life, a fascinating simulation that demonstrates the power of simple rules in
                            complex
                            systems. Allow me to give you a brief overview of this intriguing game.
                            .Let me demonstrate it to you.

                            technologies.By doing so i would be the profession on full stack development.Gaining
                            practical
                            experience before delving into theory would be my learning style.
